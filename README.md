Helloüëãüèæ. Thank you for visiting my profile üë©üèæ‚Äçüíª

As a Data Platform Engineer, I specialize in recognizing, choosing, and creating effective data systems and pipelines. These systems enable smooth and secure data flow throughout all processes, empowering data-driven decision-making.

Throughout my career, I have successfully overseen data management and business analytics tools tailored to meet the specific needs and challenges of the company. By integrating these tools with data warehouses, I have ensured efficient organization and accessibility of information.

My professional journey has been marked by involvement in projects that converge data science, data analytics, and data engineering. I have designed and maintained prediction systems that unveil hidden insights and offer valuable solutions to drive the company's growth and stability.

In pursuit of excellence, I leverage cloud technologies such as GCP and AWS, alongside DevOps best practices, for all my data projects. My proficiency in troubleshooting allows me to swiftly identify and implement solutions, ensuring timely project delivery.
